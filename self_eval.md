# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
-I am confident on searching for and finding built in methods as needed through google search and trial and error. 

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I do need a lot more repetition and reflection as I seem to not be able to always get the code correct on the first or second try. 

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Do you have any advice for when to use certain types of brackets and quotations marks. I never seem to know if I need them or not.
